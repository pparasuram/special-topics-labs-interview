## Interview  
Q1: We are so intrigued by your mastery of current topics in open source computing. I feel unless one has continuing education under a tutor like you or breaks off to go to college and focus on open source computing, one will always lag behind. Once this is over will you entertain tutoring on the side?
* _Jeremy_: I'm always open to something like that.  Of course, I think there are other options.  I believe, for instance, that CSCC has occasional hacking days with Manifest Solutions.  Also, of course, getting into an actual development position would be optimal!  

Q2: While we could look you up in linkedin, could you elaborate on how you started? You education, how you started off and how you progressed, and any advice for us to get "there"?
* _Jeremy_: Sure!  I started out at OSU as an undergrad and got my B.S. in mathematics.  I didn't want to enter the workforce quite yet so I continued on and got my M.S. in mathematics and stayed on another couple quarters to also get an M.S. in Computer Science.  After grad school I started at Lucent, just in time for the dot-com bubble to burst.  After about 9 years there, I found a position at CAS, and progressed into java software development.  As far as how to get there - what you're doing is a great start.  The most important aspect is showing interest in moving into this type of job, and proving you have that interest by going through a curriculum like this.  Networking is helpful too - talk with people working in the areas you're interested in working, and see what you can do to get yourself there!

Q3: It will be nice to know your favorite Beatles, and 5 favorite songs?
* _Jeremy_: Paul. Definitely Paul. Top 5:
  1. Here, There, and Everywhere
  2. The Abbey Road side 2 medley (You Never Give Me Your Money, Sun King, Mean Mister Mustard, Polythene Pam, She Came in Through the Bathroom Window, Golden Slumbers, Carry That Weight, and The End) - this may be cheating.  If it is, then I'll take "You Never Give Me Your Money"
  3. A Day In the Life
  4. When I'm Sixty-Four
  5. Helter Skelter

Q4: Your travel destinations that you look forward to?
* _Jeremy_: We're hoping to go to London and Paris in 2021.  I've been to Paris and can't wait to go back, and haven't been to London.  That should be awesome!  When I travel I do like to sample local food.  In fact, that's one of my favorite parts of traveling... trying food.  That being said, even in the days of the internet it can be difficult finding a good local place to eat.
