## Interview  
Q1: We are so intrigued by your mastery of current topics in open source computing. I feel unless one has continuing education under a tutor like you or breaks off to go to college and focus on open source computing, one will always lag behind. Once this is over will you entertain tutoring on the side?

Q2: While we could look you up in linkedin, could you elaborate on how you started? You education, how you started off and how you progressed, and any advice for us to get "there"?

Q3: It will be nice to know your favorite Beatles, and 5 favorite songs?

Q4: Your travel destinations that you look forward to?
